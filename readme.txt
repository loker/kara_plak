== Description ==
I've built a website for the company I'm co-founder with Jekyll as it was too small to bother with a CMS. But now, I'm thinking to move it to a Wordpress based website. Thus I've merged the very basic, vanilla theme structure offered by Automattic, _s with the latest alpha release of Bootstrap 4.
It's not a theme at all actually, I've needed a theme base without the features I know I won't use, such as comments, language support etc. So I removed them. Then added Edward McIntyre's WP bootstrap navwalker solution to themize the wordpress menu according to bootstrap's syntax.
If you need the very same thing, it'll save you an hour maybe? That's all...
== Installation ==
1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance > Themes and click the Add New button.
2. Click Upload and Choose File, then select the theme's .zip file. Click Install Now.
3. Your blog/site appears with vanilla html5 and ready to use bootstrap classes, happy hacking.
